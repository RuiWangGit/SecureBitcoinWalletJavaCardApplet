# JavaCardApplet for the Secure Bitcoin Wallet

This project is the JavaCard applet for the [Secure Bitcoin Wallet App](https://github.com/sockeqwe/SecureBitcoinWallet).

## Requirements
We use Eclipse and [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard).

The JavaCard SDK 3.0.4 (JCDK) is needed, too. You can get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/javacard/downloads/javacard-sdk-2043229.html). _ant-javacard_ has to be configured via the build.xml to find the JCDK.

Testing is done on the smartcard itself.
